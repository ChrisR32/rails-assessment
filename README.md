## Short Answer Questions
#### 1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

Currently, there are a lot of amateur and professional designers who are wanting their designs printed but cannot due to accessibility and price. There is also a market of people who own 3D printers but do not have a reason to use them on a regular basis (e.g., they have been sitting around in a garage). 

#### 2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?



#### 3. Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.

Our project will be a 2 way marketplace that allows users to sign up either as Designers or Printers, and connect with eachother to perform printing jobs for an agreed upon price. This provides an easy-to-use platform for one group to find the other, and complete the task required.

#### 4. Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.
